      <h3>Automated Switch For Clothing Iron</h3>
      <p>
        This project is motivated by the need to improve safety and reduce power waste in everyday iron
        usage. A smart solution with automatic power-off based on motion inactivity offers a practical
        way to prevent accidents caused by human forgetfulness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project presents a Smart Auto-Off Multiplug Socket which detects inactivity using
        a motion sensor connected with a wire and automatically cuts off power after a set time. The
        system is designed to be cost-effective, safe, and easy to retrofit onto any existing dry iron.
      </p>
